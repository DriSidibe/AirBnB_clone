# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Project description
The AirBnB clone utilizes higher level programming skills to deploy a copy of the AirBnB website.

## Command interpreter
console command interpreter allows the user to interact with a program using commands in the form of text lines. It was frequently used until the 1970â€™s. However, in modern times many command interpreters allow the users to create they data model, manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects and store and persist objects to a file (JSON file).
To start it, the user just need to run it like this: `(python3) console.py`.
